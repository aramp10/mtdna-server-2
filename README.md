# BU SCC Instructions

[INC20738179](https://bu.service-now.com/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/incident.do%3Fsys_id%3D0d34ff11835c7e1076b75ddfeeaad30c)
* Error message: `Failed to pull singularity image`
* Root cause/issue: the container build was initiated on a node not configured for container building
* Solution Provided: instructions for
1. Building Containers
2. Update the pipeline configuration to use the local image
3. Run the pipeline with the test profile

**Note:** the nextflow.config file has been updated to configure the pipeline to submit each task as a separate job. 

Requirements
* The required container has bee locally built and is saved in a "containers" folder - as described in the ticket
* The small input data file (`sample_S.bam`) has been downloaded to the working directory (same location as the main.nf)

Here are the commands for running the pipeline on the SCC:

```bash
cd /projectnb/ar-rcs/client/nmf35/INC20738179_Nextflow/aramp10_fork/mtdna-server-2
module load nextflow/25.04.7
# Submit each task as a job:
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,singularity -c mtdna-server-2.config
# Run the pipeline locally:
nextflow run main.nf -profile test,singularity -c mtdna-server-2.config -process.executor local
```
